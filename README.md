# Data Science Project Template

This template provides a boilerplate structure for your Data Science project, guiding you through the setup and organization of your project.

## Project Setup

- **Creating Folder in VS Code**: Create a folder for your project in your Visual Studio Code workspace.

- **Installing Git Bash**: If not already installed, you can use Git Bash for version control.

- **Initialize a Git Repository**: Manually initialize a Git repository:
  ```bash
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"


- Creating README.md: Create a README.md file to document your project.

- .gitignore File: Create a .gitignore file directly from GitHub to specify files and directories to ignore in version control.

- License: Choose and add a license to your project.

- Shell Script (sh): Create a shell script to automate common tasks and setup your project environment. This script is meant for use in Git Bash on Windows.

 ## Machine Learning Project Pipeline
1)Data Ingestion: Ingest data into your project.

2)EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Perform data exploration and analysis.

3)Feature Engineering: Create features for your machine learning model.

4)Model Building: Build and train your machine learning model.

5)Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance.

## Two Types of Pipelines
- Training Pipeline: Used for training your model.
- Testing / Prediction Pipeline: Used for making predictions.
